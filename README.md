# mcluster-LevelC

This code is the version of mcluster presented in the paper (appendix B)

Kamlah et al. (2022a) - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.511.4060K/abstract 

and it is forked from the mcluster version ([see here](https://github.com/agostinolev/mcluster)) presented in 

Leveque et al. (2022) - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.514.5739L/abstract

It contains the so-called _level C_ stellar evolution, which is described in Kamlah et al. (2022a).
This code was used in setting up initial conditions in, e.g

Kamlah et al. (2022b) - https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022MNRAS.516.3266K/abstract

## mcluster - a tool to make a star cluster

The original mcluster software ([see here](https://github.com/ahwkuepper/mcluster)) is an open source code, which is
used to either set up initial conditions for _N_-body computations or
to generate artificial star clusters for direct investigation.
